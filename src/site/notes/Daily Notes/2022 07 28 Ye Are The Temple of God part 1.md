Di saat umat Tuhan dimeteraikan di dahi mereka , ini bukan meterai yang bisa dilihat tetapi menjadi satu dengan kebenaran.
Atau kalau Kristu adalah kebenaran saya menjadi satu dengan Kristus.
Artinya kalau saya dimeteraikan saya harus menjadi satu dengan Kristus dan menjadi sama dalam segala hal (bicara tentang karakter)

## [26:23: Ringkasan](https://annotate.tv/watch/62e20d9b7bab300009ec7b8e?annotationId=62e2390dff254b0009ed13c3)

o One body [Christ is the head over all things to the church]
o One body [the fulness of Christ that filleth all in all]
o God, the Father, is "above all and through all and in you all
The body [church) is "the fulness of God, the Father, that filleth all in all"
o God, through Christ in you, then you are part of the one body [the one church]

GOD
CHRIST
THE CHURCH
THE FULLNESS OF GOD
THE FULLNESS OF GOD
THE FULLNESS OF GOD
IN CHIRST
THE FULLNESS OF CHRIST
IN THE CHURCH



## [28:56: Kutipan](https://annotate.tv/watch/62e20d9b7bab300009ec7b8e?annotationId=62e23a540e2e710009c529ce)

God, through Christ in you, then you are part of the one body [the one church]
The Spirit of God, with its vivifying (quickening-Jn 6:63] power, must be in every
human agent, that every spiritual muscle and sinew may be in exercise. Without the
Holy Spirit, without the breath of God, there is torpidity [listlessness] of conscience,
loss of spiritual life. Many who are without spiritual life have their names on the
church records, but they are not written in the Lamb's book of life [Rev 13:8). They
may be joined to the church, but they are not united [unity of the spirit] to the Lord.
They may be diligent in the performance of a certain set of duties, and may be
regarded as living men; but many are among those who "have a name that thou
livest, and art dead [Rev 3:1]. (RH January 17, 1893, par. 9)

Roh Tuhan harus berada didalam manusia kalau mau hidup secara Spiritual
Tanpa nafas Bapa dia punya pikiran lesu, dia tidak ada kehidupan Spiritual dan tidak ada the fullness of God dan dia tidak hidup (spiritualnya)

Rev 13:8 Yang namanya tidak tertulis di buku kehidupan yang akan sembah binatang

Bergabung didalam Gereja (Keanggotaan) tetapi nama mereka tidak tertulis di Buku Kehidupan.
Hidup tetapi sebenarnya mati kehidupan spiritualnya.





## [33:09: John 3:5 ](https://annotate.tv/watch/62e20d9b7bab300009ec7b8e?annotationId=62e23af5f7f89e000999bebe)

Joh 3:5 Jesus answered, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born of water
and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.
Kecuali lahir dari Roh Bapa maka kamu jadi Gereja Kristus

Heb 12:22 But ye are come unto mount Sion, and unto the city of the living
God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to an innumerable company of angels,

Ke Kota Bapa yang Hidup

Heb 12:23 To the general assembly and church of the FIRSTBORN, which are
written in heaven and to God the ludne nf all and to the enirite of inet man
Bergabung dengan assembly, bergabung dengan gereja FIRSTBORN

## THE HOUSE AND THE CHURCH

Col 4:15 Salute the brethren which are in Laodicea, and Nymphas, and the church
which is in his house.

Gereja itu bukan rumah, 
Gereja berada di dalam rumah

Phm 1:2 And to our beloved Apphia, and Archippus our fellowsoldier, and to the
church in thy house:
Phm 1:2 And to our beloved Apphia, and Archippus our fellowsoldier, and to the
church in thy house:
Rom 16:5 Likewise greet the church that is in their house. Salute my wellbeloved
Epaenetus, who is the firstfruits of Achaia unto Christ.
1Co 16:19 The churches of Asia salute you. Aquila and Priscilla salute you much in the
Lord, with the church that is in their house.



## [37:38: Kehadiran Kristus](https://annotate.tv/watch/62e20d9b7bab300009ec7b8e?annotationId=62e23bc0ff254b0009ed13c6)

God has a church. It is not the great cathedral, neither is it the national
establishment, neither is it the various denominations; it is the people who love God
and keep His commandments. "Where two or three are gathered together
in My name, there am I in the midst of them." Where Christ is, even among
the humble few, this is Christ's church, for THE PRESENCE of the High
and Holy One who inhabiteth eternity can alone constitute a church.
[17MR 81 41}

Roh Tuhan tidak berdiam di dalam Gedung, Denominasi.
Gereja adalah orang-orangnya.
Dimana 2 dan 3 berkumpul Aku berada di tengah-tengah mereka

from me.

PRESENCE?


## [42:31: Mat 28:20](https://annotate.tv/watch/62e20d9b7bab300009ec7b8e?annotationId=62e23d19f7f89e000999bebf)

Roh Ku = Roh Kebenaran yang dunia tidak bia terima karena Roh berdiam di dalam kamu

Cumbered with humanity, Christ could not be in every place personally;
therefore it was altogether for their advantage that He should leave them, go to
His father, and send the Holy Spirit to be His successor on earth. The Holy Spirit
is Himself divested of the personality of humanity and independent thereof.
He would represent Himself as present in all places by His Holy Spirit, as the
Omnipresent. {14MR 23.3)
Roh Kudus dirinya sendiri tanpa tubuh
|Roh Kudus Omnipresent yang mewakili Kristus

me: and he that loveth me shall be loved of my Father, and I will love him, and will
manifest myself to him.

thyself unto us, and not unto the world?

Joh 14:23 Jesus answered and said unto him, If a man love me, he will keep my
words: and my Father will love him, and WE will come unto him, and make OUR
abode with him [fullness].

Kami akan berada di dalam kamu dan menjadikan fullnes

Rom 8:9 But ye are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if so be that the Spirit of God
dwell in you. Now if any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his.
The spirit of God, the Father, in Christ

Only those who are living up to the light they have will receive greater light. Unless we
