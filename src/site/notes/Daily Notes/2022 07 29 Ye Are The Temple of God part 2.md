1Co 10:4 And did all drink the same spiritual drink: for they drank of that spiritual
Rock that followed them: and <mark style="background: #6e935f;">that Rock</mark> was <mark style="background: #6e935f;">Christ</mark> .
Luk 6:48 He is like a man which built <mark style="background: #6e935f;">an house</mark> , and digged deep, and laid <mark style="background: #6e935f;">the
foundation</mark>  on a <mark style="background: #6e935f;">rock</mark> [Christ]: and when the flood arose, the stream beat vehemently
upon that house, and could not shake it: for it was founded upon a <mark style="background: #6e935f;">rock</mark> [Christ].

Rumah itu harus digali dalam dan menemukan BATU (kristus) dan diatasnya rumah didirikan


## [03:22: Mat 16:13](https://annotate.tv/watch/62e2fd601b01420009899ac8?annotationId=62e2fe961b01420009899ac9)

• Mat 16:13 When Jesus came into the coasts of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his
disciples, saying, Whom do men say that I the Son of man am?
Menurut kamu , mereka pikir itu siapa

Mat 16:14 And they said, Some say that thou art John the Baptist: some, Elias;
and others, Jeremias, or one of the prophets.
Kamu  John the Baptist: some, Elias; and others, Jeremias, or one of the prophets

Mat 16:15 He saith unto them, But whom say ye
that I am?
Sesuai kamu punya pendapat aku siapa?

Mat 16:16 And Simon Peter answered and said, Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God.
Kristus adalah ANAK BAPA yang HIDUP
Mat 16:17 And Jesus answered and said unto him, Blessed art thou, Simon Barjona: for flesh and blood
hath not revealed [manifested-Rom 8:14-16] it unto thee, but my Father [the spirit of God] which is in heaven.








## [05:33: Rom 8:14-16](https://annotate.tv/watch/62e2fd601b01420009899ac8?annotationId=62e2fef86a4c3d00093cf82a)

Roh BAPA itulah yang memberikan kesaksian atau ROH BAPA itulah yang mengungkapkan.
Kamulah PETRUS  akan menjadi kepalanya.




## [07:12: Mat 16:18](https://annotate.tv/watch/62e2fd601b01420009899ac8?annotationId=62e2ff5bea33c800099e1519)

• Mat 16:18 And I say also unto thee, That thou art Peter, and upon this rock I
[Christ] will build my church; and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.
o Christ is the builder of his church upon the truth that he is the Son of the living God
Kristuslah yang membangung gereja sama dengan Tuhan Yesus yang ciptakan ADAM
o The truth that Christ is the Son of Go is the foundational doctrine of all church teachings
Kebenaran Kristus ANAK BAPA adalah fondasi gereja


## [08:54: THE STONE REJECTED - BATU DITOLAK](https://annotate.tv/watch/62e2fd601b01420009899ac8?annotationId=62e30010e548080009341e0b)

Act 4:11 This is the stone which was set at nought of you builders, which is become
the head of the corner.

Inilah batu penjuru (Kepala / Penjuru batu batu) yaitu KRISTUS adalah ANAK BAPA

• The builders stepped away from the foundation stone and left the church that was organized by Christ
Kristus yang membentuk organisasi gereja.

• They rejected the Son of God and chose to set up their own organization
Tolak batu organisasi mereka yang bangun bukan Kristus





## [11:53: Mat 7:26](https://annotate.tv/watch/62e2fd601b01420009899ac8?annotationId=62e3010505b55700097d1705)

Mat 7:26 And every one [the builders] that heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth
them not, shall be likened unto a foolish man, which built his house upon THE SAND
[Christ is not the Son of the living God]:
Artinya membangunnya di atas pasir. 

I was shown three steps-the first, second, and third angels' messages... God had led
them along step by step, until He had placed them upon a solid, immovable
platform. I saw individuals approach the platform and examine the foundation. Some
with rejoicing immediately stepped upon it. Others commenced to find fault with the
foundation. They wished improvements made, and then the platform would be
more perfect, and the people much happier. Some stepped off the platform to
examine it and declared it to be laid wrong. But I saw that nearly all stood firm upon
the platform and exhorted those who had stepped off to cease their complaints; for
God [the Father] was the Master Builder, and they were fighting against Him. {EW
258.3)
 Saya melihat orang-orang mendekati fondasi dan memeriksa fondasinya. Banyak yang bersukacita ada yang cari cari kesalahan dan mau memperbaiki fondasinya.
Fondasi diperbaiki mereka pikir lebih sempurna.
Bapa adalah yang membangunnya artinya Bapalah yang execsomai anak. Kalau tolak Anak bangun tolak juga BAPA yang bangun.
Tolak fondasi tolak BAPA yang bangun
 

## [15:58: BCL 81.3](https://annotate.tv/watch/62e2fd601b01420009899ac8?annotationId=62e30173ea33c800099e151a)

The enemy of souls has sought to bring in the supposition that a
great reformation was to take place among Seventh-day
Adventists, and that this reformation would consist in giving up the
doctrines which stand as the pillars of our faith, and engaging in a
process of reorganization. Were this reformation to take place what
would result? The principles of truth that God in His wisdom has
given to the remnant church would be discarded. Our religion
would be changed. The fundamental principles that have
sustained the work for the last fifty years would be accounted as
error. A new organization would be established. Books of a new order would be
written... Their foundation would be built on THE SAND, and storm and tempest
would SWEEP AWAY the structure. (BCL 81.3}

Setan berusaha revormasi untuk ganti organisasi Kristus. Prinsip - prinsip organisasi yang lebih dari 50 bangun akan di tolak.




## [17:52: RUMAH YANG SPIRITUAL](https://annotate.tv/watch/62e2fd601b01420009899ac8?annotationId=62e3022905b55700097d1706)

THE SPIRITUAL HOUSE
Act 6:11 Then they suborned men, which said, We have heard him speak
blasphemous words against Moses, and against God.
Act 6:12 And they stirred up the people, and the elders, and the scribes, and came
upon him, and caught him, and brought him to the council,
Act 6:13 And set up false witnesses, which said, This man ceaseth not to speak
blasphemous words against this holy place, and the law:
Act 6:14 For we have heard him say, that this Jesus of Nazareth shall destroy this
place, and shall change the customs which Moses delivered us.
.
orang menjelek-jelekkan Kaabah ini. Orang ini mau rubah segala ajaran Musa
• Joh 2:19 Jesus answered and said unto them, Destroy this temple, and in
three days I will raise it up.
Joh 2:21 But he spake of the temple of his body [the chief corner stone].
Tuhan Yesus bicara tentang tubuh bukan bangunan. Tubuh yang spiritual.




## [20:51: Acts 7:44](https://annotate.tv/watch/62e2fd601b01420009899ac8?annotationId=62e302d9ea33c800099e151b)

Act 7:44 "Our fathers had the tent of witness in the wilderness, just as he who spoke
to Moses directed him to make it, according to the pattern that he had seen.
Act 7:45 Our fathers in turn brought it in with Joshua when they dispossessed the
nations that God drove out before our fathers. So it was until the days of David,
Act 7:46 who found favor in the sight of God and asked to find a dwelling place for
the God of Jacob.
Tenda kesaksian = Tabernakel.
Joshua bawa sampai masa Daud masih ada
Daud mau bangun yang menggambarkan umat Tuhan

 

## [23:47: Act 7:47](https://annotate.tv/watch/62e2fd601b01420009899ac8?annotationId=62e303c5028bcd00099154b2)

Act 7:47 But it was Solomon who built a house for him.
Act 7:48 Yet the Most High does not dwell in houses made by hands [buildings;
great cathedrals], as the prophet says,
Act 7:49 "Heaven is my throne, and the earth is my footstool. What kind of house will
you build for me, says the Lord, or what is the place of my rest?
Salomo yang bangun namun Yang Maha Tinggi TIDAK BERDIAM di situ
Karena Bapa bilang  : Apakah kamu mau bangun rumah lalu diam disini padahal akulah pemilik sesta alam.
Buat apa bangun bangunan mewah. Tuhan tidak butuh itu.
Yang paling berharga Tuhan berdiam adalah manusia. manusia adalah Crowning Acts, puncak penciptaan.
Tidak ada yang lebih dahsyat dari pada manusia dimana ROH BAPA tinggal dua manusia.


## [27:42: Mat 16:18](https://annotate.tv/watch/62e2fd601b01420009899ac8?annotationId=62e30425eb4b3a0009bfdf13)

Mat 16:18 And I say also unto thee, That thou art Peter, and upon this rock I
[not you] will build my church; and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.
...for God [the Father] was the Master Builder, and they were fighting against
Him [the Master Builder]. (EW 258.3}
Aku yang bangun dan BAPA adalah master Builder nya
Manusia manusianyalah yang jadi bangunan rohani bukan bangunananya




## [29:18: Act 7:50](https://annotate.tv/watch/62e2fd601b01420009899ac8?annotationId=62e3047c028bcd00099154b3)

Act 7:50 Did not my hand make all these things?"
Act 7:51 "You stiff-necked people, uncircumcised in heart and ears, you always resist
[fighting against] the Holy Spirit [the spirit of God]. As your fathers did, so do you.
Menolak roh BAPA adalah bilang BANGUNAN itu GEREJA (Gereja yang dibangun kamu)




## [30:44:  Eph 1:22](https://annotate.tv/watch/62e2fd601b01420009899ac8?annotationId=62e304cd028bcd00099154b4)

• Eph 1:22 And hath put all things under his feet, and gave him to be the head
over all things to the church,
Gereja hanya Gereja kalau ROH BAPA dalam anak berdiam dari padanya
Manusia itu adalah GEREJA KRISTUS.
Eph 1:23 Which is his body, the fulness of him that filleth all in all.




## [32:09: Acts 2:1](https://annotate.tv/watch/62e2fd601b01420009899ac8?annotationId=62e30558028bcd00099154b5)

Act 2:1 And when the day of Pentecost was fully come, they were all with
one accord in one place.
Act 2:2 And suddenly there came a sound from heaven as of a rushing
mighty wind, and it filled all the house where they were sitting.
Act 2:3 And there appeared unto them cloven tongues like as of fire,
and it sat upon each of them.
Act 2:4 And they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and began to speak
with other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance.



## [34:25: Eph 4:13](https://annotate.tv/watch/62e2fd601b01420009899ac8?annotationId=62e306676e21480009ab2fd9)

Eph 4:13 Till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the
knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the
measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ [the cornerstone]:
• Christ is waiting with longing desire for the manifestation of
Himself in His church. When the character of Christ shall be
perfectly reproduced in His people [the fulness of Christ], then He
will come to claim them as His own. [COL 69.1]
. Eph 3:19 And to know the love of Christ, which passeth
knowledge, that ye might be filled with all the fulness of God.

Kita ini belajar Firman Tuhan isi Roh Kudus sampai FULNESS yang BENAR kita terima baru Roh BAPA dicurahkan di hari PENTECOST.
Gerejanya harus belajar.
Disaat Fullness barulah dia datang.
Datang Empower
Datang secara tubuh untuk jemput
Belajar untuk tidak dapat goyang. Karena fondasi saya adalah yang keluar dari mulut TUHAN YESUS
Karena ROH BAPA yang menjawab. Bagaimana bisa salah kalau pertahanan saya adalah ROH BAPA



## [38:55: The Review and Herald, July 21, 1896.](https://annotate.tv/watch/62e2fd601b01420009899ac8?annotationId=62e30789028bcd00099154b6)

The great outpouring of the Spirit of God, which lightens the whole earth with His glory [Rev 18:1],
will not come until we have an enlightened people, that know by experience what it means to be laborers
together with God. When we have entire, wholehearted consecration to the service of Christ,
God will recognize the fact by an outpouring of His Spirit without measure; but this will not be while the
largest portion of the church are not laborers together with God. God cannot pour out His Spirit when selfishness and self-indulgence are so manifest; when a spirit
prevails that, if put into words, would express that answer of Cain,-"Am I my brother's keeper?"-The Review and Herald, July 21, 1896.

Tidak bisa saya terangi dunia dengan THE FULLNESS OF GOD kalau diri sendiri belum menjadi THE FULLNESS OF GOD.
Kalau sudah penuh karena merasa diri sudah kosong baru dipenuhi diri kita dengan THE SPIRIT OF GOD.
Kalau saya masih pikir diri sendiri dan konsekwensi ini dan itu saya tidak bisa penuh.
Kalau fokus adalah orang lain supaya bisa dapat pekabaran maka saya bisa penuh.

Tidak bisa kalau cuma terima terima firman tapi tidak praktekkan.
Tidak bisa dicurahkan kalau masih EGOIS.

Saya harus saluran yang MURNI DAN KOSONG sehingga saya jadi PENUH











## [44:03: Plentiful shower](https://annotate.tv/watch/62e2fd601b01420009899ac8?annotationId=62e3088c028bcd00099154b7)

Saya harus dapat tetesan-tetesan (plentiful shower) untuk bisa dapat yang penuh 
The act of Christ in breathing upon His disciples the Holy Ghost, and in imparting His
peace to them, was as a few drops before the plentiful shower to be given on the
day of Pentecost.-The Spirit of Prophecy 3:243, 244

 Fungsi dari tetesan:
1. Membersihkan saya
2. Agar dunia bisa ????

Eze 36:25 Then will I sprinkle [few drops] clean water upon you, and ye shall
be clean: from all your filthiness, and from all your idols, will I cleanse you.
Eze 36:26 A new heart also will I give you, and a new spirit will I put within you:
and I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh, and I will give you an heart
Eze 36:27 And I will put my spirit within you, and cause you to walk in my
statutes, and ye shall keep my judgments, and do them.

Dengan Assamble kita akan keep Statutes dan Judgement (Sabath More Fully)
Saya tidak bisa kabarkan  Statutes dan Judgement kalau kita juga tidak keep

Not one of us will ever receive the seal of God while our characters have one
spot or stain upon them. It is left with us to remedy the defects in our
characters, to cleanse [few drops] the soul temple of every defilement. Then
the latter rain [plentiful shower] will fall upon us as the early rain fell upon the
disciples on the Day of Pentecost. {5T 214.2)

Mereka sudah di cleanse
Orang yang dimeteraikan adalah orang yang pelihara Statutes dan Judgement



## [49:26: Roma 4:11](https://annotate.tv/watch/62e2fd601b01420009899ac8?annotationId=62e3092ddac722000928a241)

o Rom 4:11 And he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the
righteousness of the faith which he had yet being uncircumcised: that he
might the father of all them that believe, though they be not
circumcised; that righteousness might be imputed unto them also:
Menerima tanda adalah menerima meterai. 
Belum tentu pelihara Sabath dimeteraikan kalau tolak Statutes dan Judgement

o Eze 20:20 And hallow my sabbaths; and they shall be a sign between
me and you, that ye may know that I am the LORD your God.

We have no time to lose. Would you impress the seal to obtain a clear
impression upon the wax, you do not dash it on by a violent action, but
you place the seal carefully and firmly and press it down until the wax
receives the mold. Just so the Lord is dealing with our souls..... Not now
and then, but constantly the new life is implanted by the Holy Spirit
after Christ's likeness. [HP 66.4}

Kehidupan baru di PRESS oleh ROH KUDUS
Yang memeteraikan saya adalah ROH KUDUS.
Saya tidak bisa dimeteraikan dengan ROH KUDUS kalau tolak instruksi dalam Statutes dan Judgement
ROH KUDUS itulah yang membuat dan menolong saya pelihara Statutes dan Judgement
Tolak Statutes dan Judgement adalah tolak firman TUHAN yang adalah ROH KUDUS

Bukan pengetahuan yang memeteraikan tetapi harus pelihara Statutes dan Judgement kalau mau di meteraikan.
